# JSON to CSV Converter

This script converts a JSON file into a CSV file. It reads the data from a specified JSON file, validates its structure, and writes the contents into a new CSV file.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- The following Python libraries:
  - `json` (included by default in Python)
  - `csv` (included by default in Python)
  - `os` (included by default in Python)

No additional installations are required as the script uses only built-in Python modules.

## Usage

1. **Clone or download the repository** containing this script.
2. Place your JSON file (`dummy.json`) in the same directory as the script, or update the `json_file_path` variable with the correct path to your JSON file.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
